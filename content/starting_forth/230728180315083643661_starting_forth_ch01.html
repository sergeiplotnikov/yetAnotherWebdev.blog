<b>A Living Language</b>
       Forth lets you organize your  own  procedures  and  communicate  them  to
       computer in by:

       1.     defining useful tasks and giving each task a name, then

       2.     group  related  tasks  together into larger tasks and give each of
              these a name, and so on.

       An example of the method above  is  defining  a  program  for  a  washing
       machine.  In  the  following  code,  the  colon  denotes  a begining of a
       "definition", semicolon indicates its end.

</pre><pre class="info">
: WASHER   WASH SPIN RINSE SPIN;
: RINSE   FILL AGITATE DRAIN;
: FILL   FAUCETS OPEN TILL-FULL FAUCETS CLOSE;
       </pre><pre>

       1.     "WASHER" defines 4 different cycles  of  the  washing  process  in
              order left-to-right.

       2.     "RINSE" defines 3 actions in order.

       3.     "FILL"  definition  references things (faucets) and actions (open,
              close). The word TILL-FULL was created to define  a  "delay  loop"
              that ends when the tub is full.

       If  Forth  a  "definition"  is called a "word". The "x-bit" memory volume
       usually known as "word" is called a "cell" in Forth.

<b>All This and ... Interactive!</b>

       </pre><pre>

       A brief explanation of the script above:

       1.     "STAR" uses the already defined word "EMIT" to print to the screen
              the character with an ascii value of 42.

       2.     "STARS" uses "DO" and "LOOP" to create a loop where each iteration
              executes STAR.

       3.     "MARGIN" executes CR (carriage return) to  start  a  new  line  in
              outpu and print 30 space characters using SPACES.

       4.     "BLIP" uses "MARGIN" to print a margin of 30 spaces and then pring
              a single * using STAR.

       5.     "BAR"  does  the  same as "BLIP" but prints 5 asterisk characters,
              not one.

       6.     "F" prints the capital letter F by printing a BAR then a BLIP  and
              so on.

       7.     The  last  line  of  the  script  runs words "F" and "CR", in that
              order. "F" is defined on previous line.

<b>The Dictionary</b>
       Each new word you define is added  to  Forths  "dictionary"  where  other
       words  already  contained, such as CR and EMIT. The process of taking the
       new definition and writing them to the dictionary is called  "compiling".
       Execution of a word is done by activating the INTERPRET word:

       1.     The interpreter scands the input for tokens separated by spaces.

       2.     A token is looked up in the dictionary.

       3.     If  a  definition  exists, it is passed to the EXECUTE word, which
              executes the definition.

       4.     If the interpreter did not find a definition, it calls the number-
              runner (NUMBER).

       5.     If the passed token is  indeed  a  number,  NUMBER  stores  it  in
              temporary storage for numbers.

       6.     If  the  token  is not a number (and has no definition) a question
              mark will be printed.

       The colon character is used when defining new words, the semicolon  is  a
       word in Forth and the following happens:

       1.     The interpreter find the colon in the input.

       2.     EXECUTE passes the new word definiotion to EXECUTE.

       3.     The  compiler  translates  the definition into dictionary form and
              writes is to dictionary.

       4.     When the compiler gets the semicolon, it stops.

       5.     Execution is returned to the interpreter, "ok" is returned.

<b>Say What?</b>
       In Forth, a word is a character  or  group  of  characters  that  have  a
       definition.  Here  are  the characters that can not be used is a naming a
       word:

       •      return - signals end of input.

       •      backspace - used for input editing.

       •      space - used as input delimiter.

       •      caret - will be discussed in chapter 3.

       The following words name consists of two punctuation marks. The  name  is
       pronounced  "dot-quote"  and it is written as <span class="info">." </span>.  This word can be used
       inside definitions to type a "string" of text to the terminal.

</pre><pre class="terminal">
$ cat > dot_quote_test.fth &lt;&lt;EOF
: GREET   ." Hello, I speak Forth " CR ;
GREET
EOF
$ forth -q dot_quote_test.fth
Hello, I speak Forth
       </pre><pre>

       The quotation mark at the end marks the end of  the  text  and  won't  be
       typed. It's called a "delimiter".

<b>The Stack: FORTH's Worksite for Arithmetic</b>
       Here is an example of doing arithmetics with Forth:

</pre><pre class="terminal">
$ cat > arithmetics.fth &lt;&lt;EOF
3 4 + . CR
EOF
$ forth -q arithmetics.fth
7
       </pre><pre>

       In the example above, the numbers 3 and 4 are "pushed onto the stack", by
       <span class="info">NUMBER </span>, and then the operation works on the numbers.

       In  Forth,  there  is  one central location where numbers are temporarily
       stored before being operated on, the "stack".In the example above, <span class="info">NUMBER
       </span>pushes 3 onto the stack. Then <span class="info">NUMBER </span>pushes 4 onto the stack. 4 goes on
       the "top" of the stack with 3 "below" it. The next word in the example is
       <span class="info">+ </span>which can be found in the dictionary. <span class="info">+ </span>is defined to "take  the  top
       two  numbers  off  the stack, add them, and push the result back onto the
       stack". The following word <span class="info">. </span>(dot) is also found in the  dictionary.  It
       has  been  defined  to "take the number off the stack and print it at the
       terminal".  the numbers 3 and 4 are "pushed onto the stack", by <span class="info">NUMBER </span>,
       and then the operation works on the numbers.

<b>Postfix Power</b>
       The last example demonstrated how to calculate "3+4". The expression "3 4
       +" convey the same meaning as "3+4"  but  is  written  in  the  "postfix"
       notation.  Unlike  the  "infix" (3+4). Forth uses postfix notation to put
       numbers on the stack before executing words that need them.

   <b>Examples:</b>
       •      the word <span class="info">+ </span>gets two numbers from the stack and adds them

       •      the word <span class="info">. </span>gets one number  from  the  stack  and  prints  it  to
              terminal

       •      the  word  <span class="info">SPACES  </span>gets one number from the stack and prints that
              many space-characters

       •      the word <span class="info">EMIT </span>gets one a number that represents a  character  and
              prints the character

       when  all operators are defined to work on the values that are already on
       the stack, interactions between many operations remain simple  even  when
       the program gets complex.

       Forth lets you execute a word in either two ways: by simply naming it, or
       by  putting  it  in  the definition of another word and naming that word.
       Postfix is part of what makes this possible.

       For example, lets define a word that will add the number  4  to  whatever
       number is on the stack:

</pre><pre class="terminal">
$ cat > example.fth &lt;&lt;EOF
: FOUR-MORE   4 + ;
3 FOUR-MORE . CR
-10 FOUR-MORE . CR
EOF
$ forth -q example.fth
7
-6
       </pre><pre>

       The  "4"  inside the definition goes onto the stack. Then the <span class="info">+ </span>adds the
       two numbers on the stack. Since <span class="info">+ </span>always works on the stack, it  doesn't
       matter that the "4" came from inside the definition and the "3" and "-10"
       from outside.

<b>Keep Track of Your Stack</b>
       Forth's  stack  is  described as "last-in, first-out" (LIFO). In general,
       the only accessible value at any given tiem is the top value. This can be
       demonstrated by the <span class="info">. </span>word. It removes the top number from the stack and
       prints is:

</pre><pre class="terminal">
$ cat > stack.fth &lt;&lt;EOF
2 4 6 8 . . . . CR
EOF
$ forth -q stack.fth
8 6 4 2
       </pre><pre>

       The system reads input from left to right. Numbers are added to the stack
       when encountered, words are executed. Since "8" was the last number added
       to the stack, it is the stacks top and will be the 1st to be removed.

       If we try and remove a number from and empty stack we  will  encounter  a
       "Stack underflow!" error message, not "ok".

       The  dot  always prints whatever is on the top, so if there is nothing on
       the stack, it prints whatever is just below the stack, which  is  usually
       zero.  Only  then is the error detected; the offending word (in this case
       dot) is returned to the screen, followed by the "error message".

       The opposite condition, when the stack completely  fills  up,  is  called
       "stack  overflow".  The  stack  is  so deep, however, that this condition
       should never occur except when you've done something wrong.

       It's important to keep track of new words' "stack effects"; that is,  the
       sort  of numbers a word needs to have on the stack before you execute it,
       and the sort of numbers it will leave on the stack afterwards.

       If you maintain a list of your newly created words with their meanings as
       you go, you or anyone else can easily understand the  words'  operations.
       In Forth, such a list is called a "glossary".

       To   communicate  stack  effects  in  a  visual  way,  Forth  programmers
       conventionally use a special stack notation in their glossaries or tables
       of words. Here is the basic form:

</pre><pre class="info">
(before -- after)
       </pre><pre>

       The dash separates the things that should be on  the  stack,  before  the
       word is executed, from the things that will be left there afterwards. For
       example, here's the stack notation for the dot word:

</pre><pre class="info">
.   (n -- )
       </pre><pre>

       (The  letter  "n"  stands  for  "number")  This shows that <span class="info">. </span>expects one
       number on the stack and leaves no number on the stack.

       Here's the stack notation for the word <span class="info">+ </span>:

</pre><pre class="info">
+   (n1 n2 -- sum)
       </pre><pre>

       When there is more  than  one  n,  we  number  them  n1,  n2,  n3,  etc.,
       consecutively. The numbers 1 and 2 do not refer to position on the stack.
       Stack  position is indicated by the order in which the items are written.
       The rightmost item, on either side of the dash, is the  topmost  item  on
       each  stack.  For example, in the stack notation of <span class="info">+ </span>, the n2 is on the
       top.

       Here's a list of the Forth words you've learned so far,  including  their
       stack notations ("n" stands for number; "c" stands for character):

</pre><pre class="info">
: xxx   yyy ;    ( -- )              Create a new definition with the name xxx,
                                     consisting of word or words yyy.

CR               ( -- )              Performs a carriage return and line feed
                                     at your terminal.

SPACES           (n -- )             Prints the given number of blank spaces at
                                     your terminal.

SPACE            ( -- )              Prints one blank space at your terminal.

EMIT             (c -- )             Transmits a character to the output device.

." xxx"          ( -- )              Prints the character string xxx at your
                                     terminal. The " character terminates the
                                     string.

+                (n1 n2 -- sum)      Adds.

.                (n -- )             Prints a number, followed by one space.
       </pre><pre>

<b>Review of Terms</b>
       •      Compile  -  to generate a dictionary entry in computer memory from
              source text (the written-out form of a definition). Distinct  from
              "execute".

       •      Dictionary  -  in Forth, a list of words and definitions including
              both "systems" definitions  (predifined)  and  "user"  definitions
              (which you invent). A dictionary resided in the computer memory in
              compiled form.

       •      Execute  -  to  perform.  Specifically,  to  execute  a word is to
              perform the operations specified in the compiled definition of the
              word.

       •      Extensibility - a characteristic  of  a  computer  language  which
              allows a programmer to add new features of modify existing ones.

       •      Glossary  -  a list of words defined in Forth, showing their stack
              effects and an explanation of what they  do,  which  serves  as  a
              reference for programmers.

       •      Infix  notation  -  the  method  of  writing operators between the
              operands they affect, as in "2 + 5"

       •      Input stream - the text to be read by the text  interpreter.  This
              may  be  text  that you have just typed in at your terminal, or it
              may be text that is stored on disk.

       •      Interpreter - (when referring to Forth's text interpreter) to read
              the input stream, then to find each word  in  the  dictionary  or,
              failing that, to convert it to a number.

       •      LIFO  - (last-in, first-out) the type of stack which Forth uses. A
              can of tennis balls is a LIFO structure; the last ball you drop in
              is the one you must remove first.

       •      Postfix notation -  the  method  of  writing  oprators  after  the
              operands  they  affect,  as  in "2 5 +" for "2 + 5". Also known as
              Reverse Polish Notation.

       •      Stack - in Forth, a region of memory which is controlled in such a
              way that data can be stored or removed  in  a  last-in,  first-out
              (LIFO) fashion.

       •      Stack  overflow  - the error condition that occurs when the entire
              area of memory allowed for the stack  is  completely  filled  with
              data.   Stack  underflow - the error condition that occurs when an
              operation expects a value on the stack, but there is no valid data
              on the stack.

       •      Word - in Forth, the name of a definition.

<b>Problems</b>
   <b>Problem #1</b>
       Define a word called GIFT which when executed, will type out the name  of
       some gift. For example:

</pre><pre class="info">
: GIFT   ." BOOKENDS " ;
       </pre><pre>

       Now  define  a  word  called  GIVER which will print out a person's first
       name. Finally, define a word called THANKS which includes the  new  Forth
       words GIFT and GIVER, and prints out a message something like this:

</pre><pre class="info">
DEAR STEPHANIE,
    THANKS FOR THE BOOKENDS.
       </pre><pre>

   <b>Solution #1</b>

       </pre><pre>

   <b>Problems #2</b>
       Define  a  word  called  TEN.LESS  which  takes  a  number  on the stack,
       subtracts ten, and returns the answer on the stack. (Hint: you can use <span class="info">+ </span>
       ).

   <b>Solution #2</b>
</pre><pre class="terminal">

       </pre><pre>

   <b>Problems #3</b>
       After entering the word in Problem #1, enter a new definition  for  GIVER
       to  print someone else's name, then execute THANKS again. Can you explain
       why THANKS still prints out the first giver's name?
