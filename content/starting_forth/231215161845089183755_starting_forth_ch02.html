       Forth arithmetics and stack manipulation words




<b>FORTH Arithmetic -- Calculator Style</b>
       Here are four simples integer-arithmetic operators in FORHT:

</pre><pre class="info">
+      (n1 n2 -- sum)            Adds.                    pronounced "plus"

-      (n1 n2 -- diff)           Subtracts (n1 - n2).     pronounced "minus"

*      (n1 n2 -- prod)           Multiplies.              pronounced "star"

/      (n1 n2 -- qout)           Divides (n1/n2).         pronounced "slash"
       </pre><pre>

       In  the  first  chapter, we learned that we can add two number by putting
       them both on the stack, then  executing  the  word  <span class="info">+  </span> ,  then  finnaly
       executing the word <span class="info">. </span>to get the result printed at our terminal.

</pre><pre class="info">

Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

       We can use thie method with all of FORTH's arithmetic operators. In other
       words,  we  can use FORTH like a calculator to get answers, event without
       writing a "program". Try a multiplication problem:

</pre><pre class="info">

7 8 * . 56    ok
Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

       By now we've see that the operator comes after the numbers. In  the  case
       of  subtraction  and division, though, we must also consider the order of
       numbers ("7 - 4" is not the same as "4 - 7").

       Just remember this rule: To convert to postfix, simple move the  operator
       to the end of the expression:

</pre><pre class="info">
Infix                    Postfix

3 + 4                    3 4 +

500 - 300           500 300 -

6 X 5                    6 5 *

20 /  4                  20 4 /

       </pre><pre>

       So to do this subtraction problem: <span class="info">7 - 4 = </span>

</pre><pre class="info">

       Example of division:

       </pre><pre>

       What do you do if you have more that one operator in an expression, like:
       <span class="info">4  + (17 * 12) </span>you ask? Let's take it step-by-step: the parentheses tell
       you to first multiply 17 by 12, then add 4. So in FORTH you would write:

</pre><pre class="info">
$ forth
PForth V2.0.1, LE/64, built May 12 2023 10:51:31 (static)

17 12 * 4 + . 208    ok
Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

       17 and 12 go onto the stack.  <span class="info">* </span>miltiplies them and returns  the  result
       to  the stack. Then the 4 goes onto the stack, on top of 204. <span class="info">+ </span>adds the
       two numbers returning 208 to the stack.

       No there's an interesting problem: <span class="info">(3 + 9) * (4 + 6) </span>

       To solve it  we have to add 3 to 9 first, then add 4 to 6,  then  finally
       multiply the two sums. In FORTH, we can write:

</pre><pre class="info">
$ forth
PForth V2.0.1, LE/64, built May 12 2023 10:51:31 (static)

3 9 + 4 6 + * . 120    ok
Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

<b>For Adventuresome Newcomers Sitting at a Terminal</b>
       If  you're  on of those people who likes to fool around and figure things
       out for themselves  without  reading  the  book,  then  you're  bount  to
       discover  a  copule  of  weird  things.  First off, as we told you, these
       operators are <span class="info">integer operators </span>.  That not only means that you can't  do
       calculations with decimal values, like

</pre><pre class="info">
10.00 2.25 +
       </pre><pre>

       if also means that you van only get integer results, as in

</pre><pre class="info">

21 4 / . 5    ok
Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

       Another thing is that if you try to multiply:

</pre><pre class="info">
10000 10 *
       </pre><pre>

       or  some  suck large numbers, you'll get a crazy answer. So we're telling
       you up front that with the operators introduced so far and  with  <span class="info">.  </span> to
       print  the results, you can't have any numbers that are higher than 32767
       and lower than -32768. Numbers within  this  range  are  called  "single-
       lenght signed numbers".

       Notice,  in  the  list  of  FORTH words a few pages back, the letter "n",
       which stands for "number". Since FORTH uses  single-length  numbers  more
       often than other types of numbers, the "n" signifies that the number must
       be  single-length.  And  yes,  there are other operators that extend this
       range ("double-length" operatores, which are indicated by "d").

   <b>pForth integers</b>

       </pre><pre>

       Define the word 2^10 to put 1024 (which is 2 to the 10th  power)  on  the
       stack.

</pre><pre class="info">

       2^62 is 1 followed by 62 0s.

Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

       Subtracting 1 from 2^62 is 0 followed by 62 1s.

</pre><pre class="info">

Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

       Adding the two numbers results in 2^63 - 1 which is 0 followed by 63 1s.

</pre><pre class="info">

1 +    ok
Stack&lt;10> -9223372036854775808
       </pre><pre>

       Adding  1  results in 2^63 which is 1 followed by 63 zeroes. The negative
       integer on the stack is the minimum value for a signed 64-bit integer.

<b>FORTH Arithmetic -- Definition Style</b>
       In chpater #1 we saw that we could define new words in terms  of  numbers
       and  other  pre-defined  words. Let's explore some further possibilities,
       usign some of our newly-learned math operators.

       Let's say we want to convert various measurements to inches. We know that
       <span class="info">1 yard = 36 inches </span>and <span class="info">1 foot = 12 inches </span>so we can  define  these  two
       words  where  the names symbolize "yards-to-inches" and "feet-to-inches".
       Here' what they do:

</pre><pre class="info">
$ forth
PForth V2.0.1, LE/64, built May 12 2023 10:51:31 (static)

: YARDS>IN   36 * ;    ok
Stack&lt;10>
: FT>IN   12 * ;    ok
Stack&lt;10>
10 YARDS>IN . 360    ok
Stack&lt;10>
2 FT>IN . 24    ok
Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

       If we always want our result to be in inches, we can do the following:

</pre><pre class="info">
$ forth
PForth V2.0.1, LE/64, built May 12 2023 10:51:31 (static)

: YARDS 36 * ;    ok
Stack&lt;10>
: FEET   12 * ;    ok
Stack&lt;10>
: INCHES ;    ok
Stack&lt;10>
10 YARDS 2 FEET 9 INCHES + + . 393    ok
Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

       Notice that the word <span class="info">INCHES </span>doesn't do anything except remind the  human
       user  what the 9 is there for. If we really want to get fancy, we can add
       these three definitions:

</pre><pre class="info">
: YARD YARDS ;    ok
Stack&lt;10>
: FOOT   FEET ;    ok
Stack&lt;10>
: INCH ;    ok
Stack&lt;10>
1 YARD 2 FEET 1 INCH + + . 61    ok
Stack&lt;10>
2 YARDS 1 FOOT + . 84    ok
Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

       So far we have only defined words whose definitions contain a single math
       operator. But it's perfectly possible to  put  many  operators  inside  a
       definition, if that's what you need to do.

       Let's  say  we  want  a word that computes the sum of five numbers on the
       stack. A few pages back we summed five numbers like this: <span class="info">17 20 + 132 + 3
       + 9 + . 181    ok </span>But we ca also enter <span class="info">17 20 132 3 9 + + + + . 181    ok
       </span>We get the same answer, even though we've clustered all the numbers into
       one group and  all  operators  into  another  group.  We  can  write  out
       definition like this:

</pre><pre class="info">
$ forth
PForth V2.0.1, LE/64, built May 12 2023 10:51:31 (static)

: 5#SUM   + + + + ;    ok
Stack&lt;10>
17 20 132 3 9 5#SUM . 181    ok
Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

       If  we  were  going to keep <span class="info">5#SUM </span>for future use, we could enter it into
       our ever-growing glossary, along  with  a  note  that  it  "expects  five
       arguments" on the stack, which it will add together.

       Here's  another  equation to write a definition for: <span class="info">(a + b) * c </span>Thus we
       would write the following definition, this will work as long as  we  make
       sure to push the numbers to the stack in the proper order:

</pre><pre class="info">
: SOLUTION  + * ;
c a b SOLUTION
       </pre><pre>

<b>The Division Operators</b>
       The  word  <span class="info">/  </span>is FORTH'S simplest division operator. Slash supplies only
       the quotient; any remainder is lost:

</pre><pre class="info">
$ forth
PForth V2.0.1, LE/64, built May 12 2023 10:51:31 (static)

22 4 / . 5    ok
Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

       If you're thinking of a pocket calculator's per-cent operator, then  five
       is not the full answers.

       But  <span class="info">/  </span> is  only one of several division operators supplied by FORTH to
       give you the flexability to tell the computer exactly what you want it to
       do.

       For example, let's say you want to solve this problem: "How  many  dollar
       bills can I get in exchange for 22 quarters". The real answer, of course,
       is  exactly  5, not 5.5. A computerized money changer, for example, would
       not know howto give you 5.5 dollar bills.

       Here are two more FORTH division operators:

</pre><pre class="info">
/MOD   (u1 u2 -- u-rem u-quot)   Divides. Returns the     pronounced "slash-mod"
                                 remainder and the
                                 quotient.

MOD    (u1 u2 -- u-rem)          Returns the remainder    pronounced "mod"
                                 from division.
       </pre><pre>

       The "u" stands for "unsigned". We'll see what this means in  the  chapter
       on  cumputer  numbers. For now though, it means that the numbers can't be
       negative.

       gives both the remainder and quotient; <span class="info">MOD </span> gives  the  remainder  only.
       (For  <span class="info">/MOD </span>, the stack notation in the table indicates that the quotient
       will  be  on the top of the stack, and the remainder below. Remember, the
       rightmost represents the topmost).

</pre><pre class="info">

Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

<b>Stack Maneuvers</b>
       If you worked Prob. 6 int the last set, you  discovered  that  the  infix
       equation  <span class="info">(a  -  b)/c </span>cannot be solved with a definition unless there is
       some way to rearrange values on the stack.

       Well, there is a way: by using a  "stack  manipulation  operator"  called
       <span class="info">SWAP </span>

       The word <span class="info">SWAP </span>is defined to switch the order of the top two stack items.
       As  with  other  stack manipulation operators, you can test <span class="info">SWAP </span>at your
       terminal in "calculator style"; that is, it doesn't have to be  contained
       within a definition. Using <span class="info">SWAP </span>we can define a solution for <span class="info">(a - b)/c </span>

</pre><pre class="info">

Stack&lt;10>
       </pre><pre>

       Here is a list of several stack manipulation operators, including <span class="info">SWAP </span>.

</pre><pre class="info">
SWAP   (n1 n2 -- n2 n1)          Reverse the top two      pronounced "swap"
                                 stack items.

DUP    (n -- n n)                Duplicates the top       pronounced "dupe"
                                 stack items.

OVER   (n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1)       Makes a copy of the      pronounced "over"
                                 second item and pushes
                                 it on the top.

ROT    (n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1)    Rotates the third item   pronounced "rote"
                                 to the top.

DROP   (n -- )                   Discards the top stack   pronounced "drop"
                                 item.
       </pre><pre>

   <b>DUP operator</b>
       the  next  stack manipulation operator on the list, <span class="info">DUP </span>, simply makes a
       second copy (duplicated) of the top stack item. For example, if  we  have
       "a" on the stack, we can compute a^2 as follows

</pre><pre class="info">

3    ok
Stack&lt;10> 3
DUP * . 9    ok
       </pre><pre>

   <b>OVER operator</b>
       Now somebody tells you to evaluate the expression: <span class="info">a * (a + b) </span>given the
       following  stack  order: <span class="info">(a b -- ) </span>But, you say, I'm going to need a new
       manipulation operator: I want two copies of the "a", and the "a" is under
       the "b". Here's the word you need: <span class="info">OVER </span>. <span class="info">OVER </span>simply makes a  copy  of
       the  "a" and leapfrogss it over the "b": <span class="info">(a b -- a b a) </span>. The expression
       <span class="info">a * (a + b) </span>can be solved with: <span class="info">OVER + * </span>

       When writing equations in FORTH, it's best to "factor  them  out"  firts.
       For  example,  if  somebody  asks  you  to evaluate: <span class="info">a^2 + a*b </span>is FORTH,
       you'll find it quite complicated (and maybe even  impossible)  using  the
       words we've introduced so for ... unless you factor out the expression to
       read: <span class="info">a * (a + b) </span>which is the expression we just evalutated.

   <b>ROT operator</b>
       The  fourth  stack  manipulator  on the list is <span class="info">ROT </span>(pronounced "rote"),
       which is short for "rotate". Here's what <span class="info">ROT </span>does to the top three stack
       values: <span class="info">(a b c -- b c a) </span>

       For example, if we need to evaluate the expression: <span class="info">ab - bc  </span> we  should
       first  factor  out the "b"s: <span class="info">b * (a - c) </span>Now if our starting-stack order
       is this: <span class="info">(c b a -- ) </span>we can use: <span class="info">ROT - * </span>

   <b>DROP operator</b>
       The final stack manipulation operator on the list is <span class="info">DROP </span>. All it  does
       is discard the top stack value.

   <b>A Handy Hint</b>
       Use  the  word <span class="info">.S </span>for a non-destructive stack print. This will print the
       state of the current stack without removing the values from it.

<b>Playing Doubles</b>
       The next four stack manipulation operators should look vaguely familiar:

</pre><pre class="info">
2SWAP  (d1 d2 -- d2 d1)          Reverse the top two      pronounced "two-swap"
                                 pairs of numbers.

2DUP   (d -- d d)                Duplicates the top       pronounced "two-dupe"
                                 pair of numbers.

2OVER  (d1 d2 -- d1 d2 d1)       Makes a copy of the      pronounced "two-over"
                                 second pair of numbers
                                 and pushes it on top.

2DROP  (d -- )                   Discards the top pair    pronounced "two-drop"
                                 of numbers.
       </pre><pre>

       the prefix "2" indicates that these stack manipulation  operators  handle
       numbers  in  pairs. The letter "d" in the stack effects column stands for
       "double". "Double" has a special significance that we will  discuss  when
       we discess "n" and "u".

       The  "2"-manipulators  listed above are so straightforward, we won't even
       bore you with examples.

       One more thing: there are still some stack manipulators we haven't talked
       about yet, so don't go crazy by trying too much  fancy  footwork  on  the
       stack.

<b>FORTH words covered in this chpater:</b>

*      (n1 n2 -- prod)           Multiplies.              pronounced "star"

/      (n1 n2 -- qout)           Divides (n1/n2).         pronounced "slash"

/MOD   (u1 u2 -- u-rem u-quot)   Divides. Returns the     pronounced "slash-mod"
                                 remainder and the
                                 quotient.

MOD    (u1 u2 -- u-rem)          Returns the remainder    pronounced "mod"

<b>Review of Terms</b>
   <b>Double-length numbers</b>
       integers  which  encompass  a range of over -2 billion to +2 billion (and
       which we'll introduce officially in Chapter 7).

   <b>Single-length numbers</b>
       integers which fall within the rane of -32768 to +32767: the only numbers
       which are valid as the arguments or results of any of the operators we've
       discussed so far. (This seemingly arbitrary  range  comes  from  the  way
       computers are designed, as we'll see later on.)
